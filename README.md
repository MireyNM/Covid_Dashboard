## Overview 
In this project we are going to study Covid Data by completing the following tasks:
 * Data exploration using SQL.
* Write SQL queries to create Excel tables.
* Import Excel tables into Tableau.
* Build visualizations and dashboard in Tableau.

## Aim
 The aim of our study is to use SQL and Tableau to visualize Covid Data. 

## Technologies 
* SQL 
* Tableau 
* Excel 

## Data
### Data Source 
The data was imported from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">ourworldindata.org</a>. One should note that the data used is up to May 2021. We can always add more data if we want. 

### Data Exploration
Using SQL we wrote few queries to explore the data and build few tables. 
See <a href="https://github.com/MireyNM/Covid_Dashboard/blob/main/coviddeaths.sql">coviddeaths.sql</a> 

After that we have wrote few queries to create tables that we have exported into Excel tables to be used in Tableau. See <a href="https://github.com/MireyNM/Covid_Dashboard/blob/main/create_tables.sql">create_tables.sql</a>

Finally, using Tableau we have built visualizations and dashboard.

Based on our visualization (See Fig. 1), we can conclude:
* The number of total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.
* The number of total deaths by continents. As we can see Europe had the biggest number of deaths. 
* A map showing the percent of infected by Covid per country. 
* The average percent population infected by date by country.
